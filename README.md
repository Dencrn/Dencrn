I primarily code in **HTML** as a hobby.
However, I'm mostly known for making any video that has a <img src="apple.png" width="16" /> logo on it, for some weird reason. üò®

I have over 150 subscribers on [YouTube](https://https://youtube.com/@dencrn) and over 5 followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dencrn).  
**I am [Dencrn](COMING SOON!!), but you can call me Dean.**
